**Decentralized Games: Play Fair, Play Secure, Play On-Chain.**

Welcome to the Decentralized Games Platform, a cutting-edge project that merges classic board games with the innovation of blockchain technology. Built on Lineraâ€™s Layer 1 architecture, our platform provides a secure, transparent, and engaging environment for game enthusiasts to enjoy on-chain gameplay.

Currently, you can enjoy:

## Features

- **Decentralized Multiplayer:** Compete with others in a trustless, decentralized environment using Linera's temporary chain architecture. Enjoy real-time gameplay without relying on a central authority.
- **Efficient Bitboard Representation:** Manage and compute game states quickly with bitboards, ensuring smooth gameplay.
- **Immutable Game History:** All moves and outcomes are recorded on the blockchain for a permanent, tamper-proof record.
- **Web3 Integration:** Seamlessly interact with blockchain features through an intuitive web interface.
- **Future Enhancements:** Planned updates include computer opponents for solo play and premium features for advanced users.
